# Hono to Express Migration Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the process of migrating the AI Hedge Fund API from Hono to Express. The migration was undertaken to standardize the codebase on a single web framework (Express) rather than maintaining the hybrid approach that used both frameworks.

## Changes Made

### Core Files Converted
1. **Main Server Files**
   - Updated `index.ts` to use Express instead of Hono
   - Modified server startup to use the HTTP module
   - Converted middleware usage to Express equivalents

2. **Market Data Module**
   - Converted `stocks.routes.ts` from Hono to Express
   - Converted `market-data.routes.ts` to Express
   - Converted `collection-routes.ts` to Express
   - Converted `watchlist.routes.ts` to Express

3. **Validation Approach**
   - Replaced Hono's ZValidator with custom Express middleware
   - Kept using Zod for validation schemas
   - Created custom middleware functions for route validation

### Dependencies
1. **Removed Hono Dependencies**
   - Removed `hono` package
   - Removed `@hono/zod-validator` package
   - Removed all imports from Hono packages

2. **Added/Updated Express Dependencies**
   - Added `express-validator` for validation
   - Added `helmet` for security
   - Added `morgan` for logging
   - Added type definitions for Express and related packages

## Major Changes in Development Patterns

### Request and Response Handling
- Changed from Hono's context object (`c`) to Express's `req` and `res` objects
- Updated response methods from `c.json()` to `res.json()`
- Changed status code setting from `c.json({}, 404)` to `res.status(404).json({})`

### Routing
- Replaced Hono's `app.route()` with Express's `app.use()`
- Changed from Hono's `new Hono()` to Express's `express.Router()`

### Middleware
- Implemented custom Express middleware for validation
- Updated middleware chaining approach
- Added `express.json()` for body parsing

### Error Handling
- Implemented Express's error-handling middleware
- Updated error response patterns

## Next Steps

### Remaining Tasks
1. Convert the remaining route files:
   - Notifications routes
   - User routes
   - AI Triggers routes
   - Economic Reports routes
   - Interviews routes
   - Unusual Whales routes
   - AI Query routes

2. Testing:
   - Test all API endpoints after migration
   - Verify that all validations work correctly
   - Check error handling behavior

3. Review and Cleanup:
   - Ensure consistent patterns across all routes
   - Look for any remaining Hono references
   - Run a full build and test suite

### Running the API
- Use `npm run start:prod` to start the Express server
- The API functionality should remain unchanged from a client perspective

## Benefits of Migration
1. **Simplicity**: Single framework for all API routes
2. **Maintainability**: Standard Express patterns are well-documented
3. **Community Support**: Larger community and ecosystem around Express
4. **Consistency**: Uniform approach across the entire API
5. **Learning Curve**: Express is more widely known by developers

## Conclusion
The migration from Hono to Express streamlines the codebase and establishes a single, consistent web framework throughout the API. While Hono offered some modern features, the consolidation to Express provides better long-term maintainability and reduces complexity in the codebase.
