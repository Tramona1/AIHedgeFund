## Notes

- [PAUSED: 2023-07-30] Portfolio Management feature implementation paused. We've completed the database schema and API endpoints for portfolio tracking, but haven't implemented the frontend components yet. The frontend should be view-only, focusing on providing insights and analytics rather than facilitating trades, as we're an information platform, not a trading platform.

  give SQL to create the tables in supabase so we can make sure the tables are accurate and up to date
