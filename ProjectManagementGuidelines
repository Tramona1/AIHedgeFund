### b. Resource Allocation (Phase 1 - Example Team)

**Example Team Roles (Small Team/Individual):**

*   **Role 1: Full-Stack Engineer (Backend & Frontend)** - Responsible for API development, database integration, landing page development, and deployment.
*   **Role 2: AI/Data Scientist** - Responsible for scraping script development, AI analysis, trigger generation, and data source management.
*   **(Optional) Role 3: Project Manager/Tester** - (May be combined with other roles initially) - Responsible for project coordination, task tracking, testing, documentation, and deployment management.

**Resource Tracking:**

*   Use a project management tool (e.g., Trello, Jira, GitHub Projects) to track tasks, assign responsibilities, and monitor progress.
*   Regular team check-ins (daily or bi-weekly) to discuss progress, roadblocks, and resource needs.
*   Time tracking (optional, but helpful for budget monitoring, especially for external resources).

## 2. Risk Management

### a. Identified Risks and Mitigation Strategies

| Risk                                  | Mitigation Strategy                                                                                                                             | Contingency Plan                                                                                                           | Phase Relevance |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| **X API Rate Limits/Changes**         | Monitor X API usage closely. Implement rate limiting in Python scraping scripts. Use exponential backoff for retries. Consider caching X data.       | Fallback to cached X data if API limits are reached. Prioritize other data sources for updates if X data is unavailable. | Phase 1, 2, 3  |
| **SEC EDGAR Scraping Instability**    | Use robust scraping libraries (Scrapy - consider for later phases). Implement error handling and retry logic. Respect robots.txt.                     | If SEC EDGAR scraping fails, rely on cached data or delay updates until scraping is restored.                        | Phase 1, 2, 3  |
| **Market Data API Costs/Limits**      | Choose cost-effective APIs (Alpha Vantage basic tier initially). Monitor API usage. Implement caching for market data.                                | If API costs exceed budget, reduce API usage frequency or switch to a cheaper/free alternative (if feasible).              | Phase 1, 2, 3  |
| **SendGrid Email Delivery Issues**    | Monitor SendGrid delivery rates and bounce rates. Implement email sending error handling and retry logic.  Set up email authentication (SPF, DKIM). | If SendGrid delivery fails, investigate issues with SendGrid account or consider alternative email service (if critical). | Phase 1, 2, 3  |
| **Data Source Reliability/Accuracy** | Prioritize credible data sources (listed in PRD). Implement data validation and cleaning in AI scripts. Cross-validate data from multiple sources. | If data source is unreliable, remove it from the data pipeline or flag updates derived from that source with caution.    | Phase 1, 2, 3  |
| **Development Delays**              | Break down tasks into smaller, manageable units. Track progress regularly. Implement daily/weekly check-ins. Prioritize core features for each phase.  | Re-prioritize tasks, adjust timelines, or reduce scope if necessary to meet key milestones.                          | Phase 1, 2, 3  |
| **Legal/Compliance Risks**          | Consult with legal counsel (if budget allows, especially for later phases). Draft basic privacy policy and terms of service for Phase 1.            |  Review and update privacy policy and terms of service regularly. Seek legal advice for data handling and scraping practices. | Phase 1, 2, 3  |
| **Security Vulnerabilities**          | Follow secure coding practices (outlined in rules). Implement basic security measures in each phase. Conduct security testing in later phases.          |  Regular security audits and penetration testing in later phases to identify and address vulnerabilities.                 | Phase 2, 3    |

### b. Risk Monitoring and Reporting

*   Regularly review the risk register (table above) during project meetings.
*   Track identified risks and their status (open, mitigated, resolved).
*   Escalate high-priority risks to relevant stakeholders promptly.
*   Document any new risks identified during development and update the risk register.

## 3. Documentation and Onboarding

### a. Project Documentation

*   **Project Requirements Document (PRD):**  The primary source of project vision, features, and target audience.
*   **Project Phases and Deliverables Document:** (This document) - Outlines project phases, goals, and deliverables for each phase.
*   **Project Overview and Non-Technical Guide:**  Provides a high-level overview for non-technical stakeholders.
*   **Coding Rules Documents (Backend API, Python AI, Frontend Web):**  Detailed technical guidelines for development.
*   **Project Management Guidelines:** (This document) - Outlines budget, resources, risk management, and documentation practices.
*   **API Documentation (Internal):**  Documentation for API endpoints used for AI system communication and (future) dashboard.

*   **Deployment and Operations Documentation (Phase 3):**  Documentation for setting up, deploying, and operating the service.
*   **Legal and Compliance Documentation (Phase 3):**  Privacy policy, terms of service, and any legal reviews/compliance documentation.

### b. Onboarding New Team Members

*   Provide access to all project documentation (listed above).
*   Conduct a project overview and architecture walkthrough for new team members.
*   Assign a mentor or buddy to guide new team members during onboarding.
*   Set up access to project repositories, tools, and environments.
*   Provide clear initial tasks and expectations for new team members.

## 4. Final Checklist Before Starting (Reiterated)
