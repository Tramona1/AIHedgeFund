# AI Hedge Fund - Build Steps

This document tracks the step-by-step process of building the AI Hedge Fund application.

## Setup Phase

- Added project README.md with overview and tech stack information
- Created root `tsconfig.json` for TypeScript configuration

### 2. TypeScript Project References
- Set up TypeScript project references for proper dependency management
- Added `"composite": true` to all package `tsconfig.json` files
- Created references in the root `tsconfig.json` to link packages
- Configured module resolution to use project references
- Implemented proper TypeScript builds for incremental compilation

## Backend Development (apps/api)

- Created main API entry point with route configuration
- Set up middleware for logging, CORS, and timing
- Created health check endpoint

### 2. API Module Development
- Implemented AI Triggers module (routes and service)
  - Endpoint for receiving triggers from AI system
  - Logic for processing triggers and generating notifications
- Implemented Notifications module (routes and service)
  - Logic for sending personalized emails via SendGrid
  - Email content generation based on event type
- Implemented Users module (routes and service)
  - User preferences management endpoints
  - Logic for storing and retrieving user preferences
- Implemented Updates module (routes and service)
  - Endpoints for creating and retrieving stock updates
  - Logic for storing and retrieving stock updates

## Frontend Development (apps/web)

### 1. Frontend Structure Setup
- Set up Next.js frontend with TypeScript
- Configured Tailwind CSS for styling
- Created basic layout components (Header, Footer)
- Implemented UI components using class-variance-authority

### 2. Page Development
- Created landing page with:
  - Hero section with call-to-action
  - Features section explaining how the platform works
  - Call-to-action section for user conversion
- Created dashboard page with:
  - Recent stock updates section
  - Alerts sidebar
  - Watchlist sidebar
- Created user preferences page for notification settings
- Implemented responsive design for mobile and desktop

### 3. Authentication & Authorization
- Implemented authentication using Supabase
- Set up Supabase client for user authentication and session management
- Created auth service with methods for sign-in, sign-up, and sign-out
- Built login and signup UI components
- Created middleware for protecting routes that require authentication
- Updated Header component to show login/logout based on authentication state

### 4. API Integration
- Set up API service for communicating with the backend
- Created TypeScript interfaces for data models
- Implemented data fetching in dashboard and preferences pages
- Added loading states and error handling for API requests
- Connected user preferences to backend for storing user settings

## Shared Packages Development

### Database Package (packages/db)
- Created package structure with appropriate dependencies
- Defined database schema using Drizzle ORM for:
  - User preferences table
  - Stock updates table
  - Stock events table (for AI triggers)
- Created database types and validation schemas using Zod
- Added database migration script
- Set up Drizzle config for PostgreSQL migrations

### Logger Package (packages/logger)
- Created package structure with appropriate dependencies
- Implemented logging functionality using Pino
- Added support for component-specific child loggers

### ID Generator Package (packages/id)
- Created package structure with appropriate dependencies
- Implemented ID generation functionality using nanoid
- Added support for entity-specific ID prefixes and validation

## Environment Configuration

### 1. Environment Variables Setup
- Created `.env.example` files for both apps
- Set up environment variables for:
  - Database connections
  - Authentication services
  - API URLs and endpoints
  - Email services
- Added documentation for required environment variables

### 2. Local Development Environment
- Created `.env.local.example` for frontend
- Documented required keys and values
- Implemented environment variable loading

## Current Status

### Completed
- Monorepo structure with TypeScript project references
- Backend API with core modules
- Frontend with key pages and components
- Shared packages for common functionality
- Authentication system with Supabase
- API integration for dashboard and preferences

### In Progress
- Complete end-to-end testing
- Finalizing user flows and interactions
- Optimizing build and deployment processes

## Deployment Steps
